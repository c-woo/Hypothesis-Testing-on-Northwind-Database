# Hypothesis Testing on Northwind Database

For this project, I was given the Northwind database to generate valuable analytical insights that could be of value to the company. The Northwind database is a sample database created by Microsoft for a fictitious company called Northwind Traders which imports and exports consumables around the world. Here is the schema for the database.

The following four questions were used to conduct hypothesis tests on the database:

> 1. Does discount have a statistically significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?
> 2. Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the average revenue made per product?
> 3. Does region have a statistically significant effect on the average amount spent in an order?
> 4. How does discount affect quantity ordered in different regions?

## Conclusions

* Discount does have a statistically significant effect on quantity of a product and the most effective discount levels to use are 5%, 15%, and 25%
* Only the discount level of 5% has a statistically significant effect on average revenue, all other discount levels revenue do not significantly differ from having no discount
* Western Europe and North America spend the most money per order
* Southern and Eastern Europe and Central and South America spend the least money per order
* Discount is the most effective for quantity sold in the British Isles
* Discount is the least effective for quantity sold in Central and South America
